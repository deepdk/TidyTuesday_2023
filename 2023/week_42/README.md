In the vast universe of pop culture, Taylor Swift’s music stands out like a beacon, telling stories that resonate with millions. Each track she crafts is not just a collection of notes and lyrics but a temporal journey. As fans, we’ve swayed to the rhythm and felt the pulse of her narratives, but what if we could see the very essence of these auditory experiences? My latest project does just that, transforming Taylor Swift’s discography into an interactive chart that visualizes the duration of her songs across all albums using the power of d3.js.

Song duration is more than just a number; it’s a creative choice that can shape the listener’s experience. With this chart, we see the evolution of Taylor Swift’s storytelling through time. We notice how her earlier albums feature shorter, radio-friendly tracks, while her later works show a trend towards longer, more introspective compositions.
